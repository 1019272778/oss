# Put Object ACL {#reference_fs3_gfw_wdb .reference}

The Put Object ACL interface is used to modify the access permission of an object.

Currently, an object may have four types of access permissions: default, private, public-read, and public-read-write. You can use the "x-oss-object-acl" header in the Put Object ACL request to set the access permission. Only the bucket owner has the permission to perform this operation. If the operation succeeds, 200 is returned; otherwise, the corresponding error code and prompt message are returned.

## Request syntax {#section_ign_5fw_wdb .section}

```
PUT /ObjectName? acl HTTP/1.1
x-oss-object-acl: Permission
Host: BucketName.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com
Date: GMT Date
Authorization: SignatureValue
```

## Definition of Object ACL {#section_bg5_wfw_wdb .section}

|Name|Description|
|:---|:----------|
|private|This ACL indicates that an object is a private resource. Only the owner of this object has the permission to read or write this object.|
|public-read|This ACL indicates that an object is a resource that can be read by the public. Only the owner of this object Â has the permission to read and write this object. Other users only have the permission to read this object.|
|public-read-write|This ACL indicates that an object is a resource that can be read and written by the public. All users have the permission to read and write this object.|
|default|This ACL indicates an object is a resource inheriting the read-write permissions of the bucket. That is, the bucket and the object have the same permissions.|

## Detail analysis {#section_ik1_zfw_wdb .section}

-   Read operations to an object include: the read operations to the source object in GetObject, HeadObject, CopyObject, and UploadPartCopy. Write operations to an object include: the write operations to a new object in PutObject, PostObject, AppendObject, DeleteObject, DeleteMultipleObjects, CompleteMultipartUpload, and CopyObject.
-   The x-oss-object-acl must be set to one of the preceding four permissions. Otherwise, OSS returns the 400 Bad Request message and the error code is: InvalidArgument.
-   You can use PutObject ACL to set the ACL of an object. In addition, when writing an object, you can include x-oss-object-acl in the request header to set the ACL of the object. The effect is equivalent to PutObject ACL. For example, if the header of the PutObject request carries x-oss-object-acl, you can set the ACL of an object while uploading the object.
-   When a user who has no permission to read an object reads the object, OSS returns the 403 Forbidden message and the error code is: AccessDenied. The message displayed is: You do not have read permission on this object.
-   When a user who has no permission to write an object writes the object, OSS returns the 403 Forbidden message and the error code is: AccessDenied. The message displayed is: You do not have write permission on this object.
-   Only the owner of a bucket has the permission to call the PutObject ACL to modify the ACL for an object in this bucket. When a non-bucket owner calls the PutObject ACL, OSS returns the 403 Forbidden message and the error code is: AccessDenied. The message displayed is: You do not have write acl permission on this object.
-   The object ACL takes precedence over the bucket ACL. For example, if the bucket ACL is private and the object ACL is public-read-write, the system first checks the ACL of the object when a user accesses the object. As a result, all users can access this object even if the bucket is a private bucket. If the ACL of an object has never been set, the ACL of this object is same as that of the bucket where the object is located.
