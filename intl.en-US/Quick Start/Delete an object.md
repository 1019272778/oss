# Delete an object {#task_pgg_qt4_tdb .task}

If you no longer need to store an object in OSS, delete it to avoid further charges.

You can delete a single object or multiple objects in the OSS console. The deleted object cannot be recovered. Perform this operation with caution.

**Note:** You can delete up to 1,000 objects at a time in the console. If you want to delete only the selected objects or delete more than 1,000 objects, see [Delete objects](../../../../intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Manage files/Delete an object.md#) in the *OSS Developer Guide*.

1.   Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/). 
2.   In the bucket name list, select the name of the bucket that you want to delete an object from. 
3.   Click Files. 
4.  Select one or multiple objects, and then click **Delete** to open the Delete File dialog box. 
5.   Click **OK**.
