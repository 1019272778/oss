# Delete an object {#task_pgg_qt4_tdb .task}

If you do not need to store uploaded files any longer, delete them to avoid further fees. You can delete a single file or multiple files on the OSS console. The deleted file cannot be recovered. Perform this operation with caution.

**Note:** You can delete up to 1,000 files at a time on the console. If you want to delete only the selected files or perform batch deletion in a larger volume, follow the procedures in API or SDK documents.[Â For more information, see the relevant sections of the](../intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Managing Objects/Delete an object.md#).

3.   Click Files. 
4.   Select one or multiple files, and then click **Delete** to open the Delete File dialog box. 
5.   Click **OK**.
