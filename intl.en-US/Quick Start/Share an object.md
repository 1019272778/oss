# Share an object {#task_wlr_lr4_tdb .task}

After an object is uploaded to a bucket, the object can be shared and downloaded by others, using the object’s address.

1.   Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/). 
2.   In the left-side bucket list, click the name of the target bucket to open the overview page of the bucket. 
3.   Click the Files tab. 
4.   Click the name of the target file to open the Preview page of the file. 
    -   **Open File URL**: used to open the file in the browser.
    -   **Copy File URL**: used to download the file.
    -   **Copy File Path**: used to search a file or watermarking an image file.
5.   Click **Copy File URL** and give it to any user who needs to browse or download the file. For files that do not support browsing directly, such as Excel files. Open the URL and download it directly. 

    If your bucket is set to Private, you must set the Validity when getting a file URL.

    **Note:** The link validity period for URL signature is calculated based on NTP.  You can give this link to any visitor who can then use it to access the file within the validity period.  If the bucket has a private permission, the obtained addresses are generated by [Add a signature to a URL](../intl.en-US/API Reference/Access control/Add a signature to a URL.md#) .
