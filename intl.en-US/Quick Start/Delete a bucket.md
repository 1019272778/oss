# Delete a bucket {#task_pkl_qdp_tdb .task}

If you do not need a bucket, delete it to avoid further charges.

Before you delete a bucket, ensure that all objects in it are deleted, including parts generated by the incomplete multipart upload. Otherwise, you are unable to delete the bucket.

**Note:** A deleted bucket cannot be recovered. Therefore, delete buckets with caution.

1.   Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/). 
2.   In the bucket name list, click the name of the bucket that you want to delete, and then click **Delete Bucket**. 
3.   In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.
