# Delete a bucket {#task_pkl_qdp_tdb .task}

If you do not need a bucket, delete it to avoid further charges. To delete a bucket, make sure all objects in it are deleted, including parts generated by incomplete multipart upload. Otherwise, you are unable to delete the bucket.

Procedure

1.   Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/). 
2.   In the bucket name list, click the name of the bucket that you want to delete, and then click**Delete Bucket**. 
3.   In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**. 

    **Note:** A deleted bucket cannot be recovered. Therefore, delete buckets with caution.
