Alibaba Cloud’s permission management mechanism includes Resource Access Management \(RAM\) and Security Token Service  \(STS\). This enables users to access OSS through subaccounts with different permissions and grants users temporary access authorization. Usage of RAM and STS can greatly improve management flexibility and security.
