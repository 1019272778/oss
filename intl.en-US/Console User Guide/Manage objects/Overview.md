# Overview {#concept_jft_vhg_vdb .concept}

In OSS, the basic data unit for user operations is an object. The size of a single object is limited to 48.8 TB. An infinite number of objects can exist in a single bucket.

After you create a bucket in a region, the objects uploaded to the bucket are retained in this region, unless you transmit the objects to another region on purpose.  Objects stored in an Alibaba Cloud OSS region are physically retained in this region.  OSS  does not retain copies or move the objects to any other region.  However, you can access these objects from anywhere if you have permissions.

You must have the write permission to the bucket before uploading an object to  OSS.  In the console, the uploaded objects are displayed as files or folders to users.  This section describes how to create, manage, and delete files and folders using the console.
