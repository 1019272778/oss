# Delete a bucket {#concept_bcz_sbz_5db .concept}

If you do not need a bucket, delete it to avoid further charges.

## Prerequisite {#section_q5s_sfz_5db .section}

To delete a bucket, make sure all objects in it are deleted, including parts generated by incomplete multipart upload. Otherwise, you are unable to delete the bucket.

**Note:** 

-   If you want to delete all objects in a bucket, we recommend that you use [Set lifecycle](intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Set lifecycle.md#).
-   For detailed procedures on how to delete parts, see [Manage fragments](intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage fragments.md#).

## Procedure {#section_azm_ybz_5db .section}

1.  Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/) .
2.  In the bucket list on the left, click the name of the target bucket, and then click **Delete Bucket** in the upper-right corner.
3.  In the dialog box that appears, click **OK**.

    **Note:** A deleted bucket cannot be recovered. Therefore, delete buckets with caution.
