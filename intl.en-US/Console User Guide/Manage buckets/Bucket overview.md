# Bucket overview {#concept_znd_p1z_5db .concept}

All files of Alibaba Cloud OSS are stored in buckets. A bucket is a unit that allows you to manage stored files. Files in a bucket are stored in a non-hierarchical structure instead of a directory-based file system. You can set the attributes of a bucket to control the region, the ACL of stored files, and the life cycle of the stored files. These attributes apply to all files stored in the bucket. Therefore, you can create buckets with different settings to complete different management tasks.

The following picture shows the overview page of a bucket:
