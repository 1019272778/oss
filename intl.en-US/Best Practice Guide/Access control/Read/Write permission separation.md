# Read/Write permission separation {#concept_fs4_zsz_5db .concept}

When the users want to use an application server to provide external service, OSS can store back-end static resources. In this case, we recommend that the application server be granted the OSS read-only permission to reduce the risk of attacks. The read and write permission separation can be configured to grant the application server a user with the read-only permission.

1.  Create an account ram\_test\_pub. As shown in the following figure, select ReadOnly in the authorization management area:
2.  You can now use the AccessKey of the subaccount to test the upload and download permissions.Â  The AccessKey here is a ram\_test\_pub AccessKey and is to be replaced with your own AccessKey during the test.

```
$./osscmd get oss://ram-test-dev/test.txt test.txt --host=oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com -i oOhue******Frogv -k OmVwFJO3qcT0******FhOYpg3p0KnA
100% The object test.txt is downloaded to test.txt, please check.

```
$. /Osscmd put test.txt OSS: // Ram-test-dev/test.txt -- Host = porteroohue ****** frogv-K OmVwFJO3qcT0 * FhOYpg3p0KnA?

With reference to the preceding example, we can conclude that the ram\_test\_pub account cannot be used to upload files.
