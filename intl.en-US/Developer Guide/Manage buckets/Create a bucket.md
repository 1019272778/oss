# Create a bucket {#concept_ntj_wx1_5db .concept}

Before you can upload any data to OSS, you must create a bucket in one of Alibaba Cloud regions to store your data. A bucket name must be unique across all existing bucket names in Alibaba Cloud OSS. Once a bucket is created, its name and region cannot be modified.

OSS provides an Access Control List \(ACL\) for permission control. Bucket ACLs are access policies that grant access permissions to buckets. The default ACL of a bucket is Private. You can set the ACL when creating a bucket. You can also modify the ACL after the bucket is created. For more information, see [Set bucket ACL](intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Manage buckets/Set bucket read and write permissions.md#).
