# Delete a bucket {#concept_xst_dbb_5db .concept}

Before you can delete the bucket you have created, you must delete all the objects and fragments in the bucket. We recommend that you define object lifecycle rules to delete all the objects and fragments in a bucket. For more information about how to define object lifecycle rules, see [Manage object lifecycle](intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Managing Objects/Manage object lifecycle.md#).
